# Dynamic Routing Mechanism Design Using Dijkstra's Algorithm in a Faulty Network


**Course**: COMP/ECPE 177 
**Team Members**: Loc Nguyen, Richard Hull, Anna Noto
**Semester**: Fall 2024

## Project Overview
This project simulates dynamic routing in network graphs using Python's NetworkX library. The goal is to compute and visualize shortest paths within a network while dynamically adapting to changes, such as node or edge failures. The implementation uses Dijkstra's algorithm to determine paths and showcases resilience in varying network conditions.

The project includes the following scripts:
1. **`dynamic_routing.py`**: Routing in a 9-node network.
2. **`dynamic_routing_20_Node.py`**: Routing in a 20-node network with random node removals.
3. **`dynamic_routing_50_node.py`**: Routing in a 50-node network.
4. **`dynamic_routing_node_generation.py`**: Custom adjacency matrix generation and fault simulation.
